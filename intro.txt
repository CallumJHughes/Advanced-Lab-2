For this experiment, a Monte-Carlo algorithm will be used to change the dipoles ('spin') in an Ising Model (can take dicrete 
values of +1 or -1). In the Monte-Carlo algorithm the spin of a randomly selected value, Si, will be changed, creating a 'new'
and an 'old' state. The energy of each state will then be calculated using the spins of the selected dipole, Si, and its 
neighbours, Sj. The energy change between these two different states will then be calculated. If this energy change is 
less than 0, then the spin will remain in the new state i.e. Si is the opposite of what it was originally. If the Energy 
is greater than zero, a random number, r, will be selected between 0 and 1, and if r is less than exp(-deltaE/kT) then the 
spin will remain at its new value, else it will be returned to its original value. This process will be repeated across all 


This algorithm will then be looped over a number of steps, taking the average of the magnetisation

DO temperature = 1,2,3,...
  DO time = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,...
    IF mod(time,10) == 0
      CALCULATE average of M using t0=time-9 and t=time
    ELSE
      DO elements of state matrix (Sij)
        change spins etc...
        ...
        ...
      END DO
    END IF
  END DO
END DO


End time loop when <M> is found (When M vs time step flattens)

Find M(T) by plotting <M> against temperature

SKIPPING TIME STEPS AT TIME=10,20,30,...
THEREFORE STILL NEED TO CHANGE SPINS AT THESE TIME STEPS
